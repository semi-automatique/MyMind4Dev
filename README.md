MyMind4Dev
==========
Be more **efficient** at **software development** using **mind maps**.
This is what **MyMind4Dev** is about. This project give you the tools
to go from **your first idea** to a **complete software** mixing
unstructured idea with structure code in **mind maps**. It is a kind
of **literate programming** where you can **visually structure** your
**code** and **documentation** without having to learn a **new visual
programming language**.  You just have to start using **MyMind4Dev**
with **your software development platform** and youâ€™re ready
to go.

But first **you need** to **configure minimally** your environment.
